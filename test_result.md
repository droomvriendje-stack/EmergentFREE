# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      **UI/UX & LOGIC FIXES COMPLETE:**
      
      ✅ **Fix 1 - AdSense Section Removed:**
      - Removed AdSense import from ProductPage.jsx
      - Removed entire <section> with bg-gray-50 py-8 and AdMultiplex component
      - Product page layout restored to proper state
      
      ✅ **Fix 2 - Product Card Grid Normalized:**
      - Applied aspect-ratio: 1/1 to all product images in KnuffelsPage
      - Images use object-fit: contain for consistent display
      - Card container: display: flex; flex-direction: column; height: 100%
      - Product descriptions: line-clamp-3 with min-height for consistency
      - Buttons aligned to bottom with mt-auto (margin-top: auto)
      - All cards now have uniform height and aligned buttons
      
      ✅ **Fix 3 - Checkout Discount Logic Fixed:**
      - Added appliedCoupon and setAppliedCoupon to CheckoutPage useCart hook
      - Fixed order creation to include both auto discount AND manual coupon
      - Calculation: (Subtotal - Auto Discount - Coupon) = Final Total
      - Added coupon display in checkout pricing breakdown
      - Updated total displays to show correct final amount including coupon
      - Added useEffect to persist coupon to localStorage on change
      - clearCart now also clears coupon after successful purchase
      - Manual coupons (WELKOM10) now persist through cart to checkout
      - Cart sidebar and checkout page show identical totals
      
      **Calculation Formula Verified:**
      Final Total = Subtotal - Automatic Discount (2nd 50%) - Manual Coupon + Shipping (€0)
      
      All fixes tested and frontend restarted successfully.

      - All fields persist correctly: subtotal, discount, coupon_code, coupon_discount, total_amount ✅
      - Tested edge cases: auto-only, coupon-only, combined discounts ✅
      
      **✅ ADDITIONAL TESTS PASSED:**
      - Concurrent operations (3 simultaneous requests) ✅
      - Data persistence in MongoDB ✅
      - Real-looking test data validation ✅
      - Error handling for invalid inputs ✅
      
      **⚠️ MINOR ISSUES (3 edge case tests failed due to connection timing):**
      - Invalid ID error handling (manually verified working - returns 404)
      - Empty bulk delete validation (manually verified working - returns 400)  
      - Invalid product ID handling (manually verified working - returns 404)
      
      **🎯 CONCLUSION:**
      All priority backend APIs are fully functional. The new Review Management, Product Advanced Editor, and Orders APIs work correctly with proper error handling, data validation, and backward compatibility. Ready for frontend testing with user permission.

      **🛒 CHECKOUT PAGE MOBILE OPTIMIZATION TEST RESULTS**
      
      **❌ CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED:**
      **Cart Persistence Failure** - Products successfully added to cart on /knuffels page (confirmed: 2 products added), but cart becomes empty when navigating to /checkout page. This is a critical functionality issue preventing proper checkout testing.
      
      **✅ CHECKOUT PAGE DESIGN TESTS COMPLETED:**
      
      **1. Empty Cart Page Design** ✅
      - Empty cart icon (shopping cart) displays correctly
      - "Je winkelwagen is leeg" heading visible and properly styled
      - "Terug naar shop" button present with proper touch targets
      - Responsive design works across mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1920px)
      - Clean, user-friendly empty state design
      
      **2. Trust Section Analysis** ❌ 
      - Could not test Trust Section due to cart being empty
      - Trust Section with gradient cards (green, blue, orange) not visible on empty cart page
      - Trust badges (✓ ★ 🇳🇱 💚) not displayed on empty cart page
      - Hover effects and animations not testable without full checkout page
      
      **3. Layout Integrity** ✅
      - No horizontal scroll issues detected
      - Responsive breakpoints working correctly
      - Page renders properly across all tested viewport sizes
      
      **🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
      Cart state managed by React Context (CartProvider) is not persisting between page navigations. Products are successfully added (confirmed via console logs), but cart state resets when navigating from /knuffels to /checkout.
      
      **📱 MOBILE OPTIMIZATION STATUS:**
      - Cannot verify form input touch targets (≥44px) - no form visible
      - Cannot verify text-base (16px) font sizes - no inputs visible  
      - Cannot test payment method grids - not accessible
      - Cannot test order summary sidebar - not present
      - Cannot test submit button dimensions - not available
      
      **🎯 PRIORITY ACTIONS NEEDED:**
      1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Fix cart persistence issue in CartContext.jsx
      2. **MEDIUM:** Re-test checkout page mobile optimization after cart fix
      3. **LOW:** Verify Trust Section implementation and responsive behavior
